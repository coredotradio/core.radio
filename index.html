    <h2><span>Meetings</span> Hang out, learn, and share</h2>
    <p>
      While Discord is our main hub, we have in-person meetups as well.
      Meetings are casual gatherings where you can listen to a talk, see and
      share projects, and chat with other radio curious folks. Maybe you'll
      even want to give a talk yourself! And, of course, a trip to the pub
      afterwards is always on the table.

        <h3>When</h3>
        <p>
          We're still figuring out a regular cadence but we're planning on
          monthly. Join <a href="#get-involved">Discord</a> for the first
          announcement.

        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>
          We're looking for a venue. If you have suggestions or can host a
          small meetup, reach out on <a href="#get-involved">Discord</a> or
          <a href="#get-involved">send an email</a>.

    <h2><span>Community Guidelines</span> Three rules. That's it.</h2>
    <p>
      We want CORE to be a place where anyone can show up, ask questions, and
      feel welcome. Our rules are simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Rule 1</span>
        <span>Don't be a jerk.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Rule 2</span>
        <span>Don't do anything that makes us add a new rule.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Rule 3</span>
        <span>If you're not sure if rule 2 will be invoked, see rule 1.</span>

  <section id="faq">
    <h2><span>FAQ</span> Questions you might have</h2>
    <div>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need a ham radio license to join?</summary>
        <p>
          Nope. CORE is open to everyone and actively seeks to be more than
          just a ham radio club. Licensed hams, GMRS users, Meshtastic
          enthusiasts, scanner listeners, and people who are just curious about
          radio are all welcome. You don't need any credentials to show up, to
          join the Discord server, or come to a meetup. Of course, if you want
          to get licensed, we'd love to help with that too.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Are there any membership fees or dues?</summary>
        <p>
          No. There's no membership, no dues, and no registration. You're part
          of the community just by showing up. If we ever need to collect money
          for a specific thing—say a workshop that requires materials—we'll
          tell you before hand.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I'm a total beginner. Will I be lost?</summary>
        <p>
          Maybe. But you definitely won't be made to feel dumb and we'll help
          you out. The community spans noobs to seasoned pros. Beginners asking
          questions is a feature, not a bug—most of us love explaining stuff.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Where do you meet?</summary>
        <p>
          We're still figuring that out. Somewhere in Central Ohio, of course.
          Likely a makerspace, public library, or helpful corporate sponsor.
          Join the Discord to get notified when the first meetup is announced.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What should I bring to a meetup?</summary>
        <p>
          Just yourself. Maybe something to take notes with. If you have a
          project, gadget, or antenna you want to show off or have questions
          about, bring it. If you want to give a short informal talk about
          something you've been working on or are passionate about, reach out
          on Discord or send an email and we'll get you scheduled.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>I'm already in a radio club. Can I still join CORE?</summary>
        <p>
          100%. CORE isn't trying to replace radio clubs and, if anything,
          could help existing clubs by providing a more casual space for people
          who might be interested in radio but are intimidated by a ham club. A
          lot of our members are active in radio clubs and other organizations.
          We just fill a different niche: more informal, broader topics, and
          more maker and developer oriented.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How is this different from a regular ham radio club?</summary>
        <p>
          Traditional clubs are great, but they tend to be more formal and more
          narrowly focused on licensed amateur radio. CORE is deliberately
          informal and welcomes anyone interested in radio technology—including
          GMRS, Meshtastic, SDR, LoRa, and development. No bylaws, no officers,
          no required attendance. Just people who like radio.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I give a talk or demo something at a meetup?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes, please. Talks and demos are the whole point. They don't need to
          be polished—a 10-minute "here's what I've been messing with" is fine.
          So is a 1-hour presentation on radio theory. Just mention it on
          Discord or email us and we'll get you on the agenda.
